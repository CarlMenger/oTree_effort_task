        - how winning bonus works (t0 - more points == win; t1,t2 - last round is who wins,..., tie means
        split the winning bonus
        - they will not know the reward for Experiment 2 (aka this after diya s) buy they will be compensated
        for this  //point is so they do not get wealth effect, so they dont know how much money they get before
